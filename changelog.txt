- Removed unsued colour values in the file "colors.xml". We are only using the "nai_theme" as the default colour scheme.

Issues

- The program is able to downlaod files such as PDFs via the webview element, but will crash when you click on the downlaod button for the stories inside of the Novel AI website. This may be due to the file type. Tested on the Pixel 3A API 30 x86.
